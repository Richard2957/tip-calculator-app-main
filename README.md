## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript




### What I learned
Lots to do in this project which took me all day. Got stuck with two things. Getting the Custom Percentage box was fiddly but where I really got stuck was with dealing with the event handlers bubbling from the inout box to the button and giving a runtime error. Kludged this by just adding a try{} finally{}.
Also getting the $ icon (wot no Â£) and the People icon to display in the right place was also very tricky, finally stumbled across the vertical-align property.
